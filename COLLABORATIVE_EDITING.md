# 🤝 Collaborative Editing Features

## Overview
Your TripPlanner now supports **collaborative editing** where trip owners can invite other users to edit their trips! This creates a true collaborative experience where multiple people can work together on trip planning.

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. **Trip Owner Permissions**
- ✅ **Add Collaborators**: Invite users by username
- ✅ **Remove Collaborators**: Remove users from editing access
- ✅ **Full Control**: Edit, delete, and manage the trip
- ✅ **View Collaborators**: See who has access to edit

### 2. **Collaborator Permissions**
- ✅ **Edit Trip**: Full editing access to trip details
- ✅ **View Collaborators**: See all collaborators
- ❌ **Cannot Delete**: Only trip owner can delete
- ❌ **Cannot Manage**: Cannot add/remove other collaborators

### 3. **Visual Indicators**
- ✅ **Collaborator Count**: Shows number of collaborators on trip cards
- ✅ **Edit Indicators**: "✏️ You can edit this trip" for collaborators
- ✅ **Role Display**: Clear owner vs collaborator distinction
- ✅ **Permission Badges**: Visual role identification

## 🎯 User Experience

### For Trip Owners:
1. **Create a trip** (normal process)
2. **View trip details** and click "Add Collaborator"
3. **Enter username** of the person you want to invite
4. **Manage collaborators** - add/remove as needed
5. **Collaborators can now edit** your trip

### For Collaborators:
1. **Get invited** by a trip owner (by username)
2. **See notification** on trip cards showing edit access
3. **Edit trip details** just like the owner
4. **Cannot delete** the trip or manage other collaborators

### Visual Flow:
```
Trip Owner → Invites User → User becomes Collaborator → Can Edit Trip
     ↓            ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  Creates      Adds by           Gets edit access      Full editing
   Trip       username           notification          capabilities
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### Database Schema (`server/models/TripPlan.js`)
```javascript
collaborators: [{
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User'
}],
isPublic: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: true
}
```

#### New API Endpoints (`/api/collaborators/`)
```javascript
GET    /api/collaborators/:tripId           // Get collaborators
POST   /api/collaborators/:tripId           // Add collaborator
DELETE /api/collaborators/:tripId/:userId   // Remove collaborator
```

#### Permission Logic (`server/controllers/tripController.js`)
```javascript
// Allow owner and collaborators to edit
const isOwner = trip.userId.toString() === req.user._id.toString();
const isCollaborator = trip.collaborators.some(
  collaboratorId => collaboratorId.toString() === req.user._id.toString()
);

if (!isOwner && !isCollaborator) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'No edit permission' });
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### Collaborator Manager Component
- **Location**: `client/src/components/trip/CollaboratorManager.jsx`
- **Features**: Add/remove collaborators, role display, permissions
- **Integration**: Embedded in trip detail pages

#### Updated Permission Checks
- **Trip Cards**: Show edit buttons for owners and collaborators
- **Trip Details**: Edit/delete buttons based on permissions
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear role identification

## 🎮 Testing the Feature

### Test Scenario 1: Owner Invites Collaborator
1. **User A** (Owner): Create a trip
2. **User A**: Go to trip details → Add Collaborator
3. **User A**: Enter User B's username → Add
4. **User B**: Login and view dashboard
5. **User B**: Should see "✏️ You can edit this trip" on User A's trip
6. **User B**: Click Edit → Should be able to modify the trip

### Test Scenario 2: Collaborator Edits Trip
1. **User B** (Collaborator): Edit User A's trip
2. **User B**: Change title, description, or activities
3. **User B**: Save changes
4. **User A**: Should see User B's changes immediately
5. **User B**: Should NOT see Delete button (owner-only)

### Test Scenario 3: Owner Removes Collaborator
1. **User A** (Owner): Go to trip details
2. **User A**: Click "Remove" next to User B in collaborators list
3. **User B**: Should lose edit access to the trip
4. **User B**: Trip card should no longer show edit indicator

## 🔒 Security Features

### Permission Validation
